## Requirements

* Ansible 2.5


## Additional variables

Additional variables that can be used (either as `host_vars`/`group_vars` or via command line args):

| Variable                                         | Description                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `aws_vpc_route_table_profile`                    | Boto profile name to be used |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_default_region`             | Default region to use        |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_state`             | Default is `present`, possible values: `present` or `absent`. absent deletes the resource        |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_vpc_filter_additional`      | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `vpc_filter` and `vpc_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_instance_filter_additional` | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `instance_filter` and `instance_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_eni_filter_additional`      | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `eni_filter` and `eni_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_nat_filter_additional`      | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `nat_filter` and `nat_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_vgw_filter_additional`      | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `vgw_filter` and `vgw_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_subnet_filter_additional`   | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `subnet_filter` and `subnet_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_peering_filter_additional`  | Additional `key` `val` filter to add to `peering_filter` and `peering_name` by default. |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_purge_routes`               | Boolean flag for toggling the [union][1] of routes as described locally (Ansible) vs. remote (AWS). `Default: True` |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_purge_subnets`              | Boolean flag for toggling the [union][1] of subnets as described locally (Ansible) vs. remote (AWS). `Default: True` |
| `aws_vpc_route_table_purge_tags`                 | Boolean flag for toggling the [union][1] of route table tags as described locally (Ansible) vs. remote (AWS). `Default: True` |

__Important:__ the above three variables responsible for purging entries on AWS
are scoped for the whole role invocation, even though the role supports taking
in a list of route tables to handle.
